# Doubts and Learning

I struggled with question 3 because I found it difficult to solve problems involving more than three numbers and I wasn't familiar with lists in Python.  
After researching, I learned how to solve it using built-in functions as well as with 'for' and 'if' loops, which made the logic clearer for me.
